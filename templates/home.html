       At Juniper, our mission is to connect everything and empower everyone. What does that mean? It means contributing to things people use every day, like supporting over 4.5 billion updates daily on the world's top 5 social media properties, enabling 7 of the 8 world's largest stock exchanges, and securing over 85% of all US smartphone traffic. It means enabling our customers to do amazing things. It also means you will see your work used virtually everywhere—everything from medicine, science, education, business, entertainment, and more—that's what we're doing here at Juniper Networks.
